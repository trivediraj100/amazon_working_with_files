       "  'You are an experienced hands-on manager with a background in developing and delivering software that simplifies solutions for a broad set of related problems. You have a strong technical ability, great communication skills, and know how to inspire your team to achieve outstanding results in a fast paced environment. You have a track record of building and leading strong teams of talented engineers and you enjoy working with smart people. In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.AWS Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any AWS service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing AWS business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine \"declarative\". We want to make it super easy for sellers of cloud services to create complex pricing plans with minimal or no code changes whatsoever.Key Responsibilities:· Adopt overall AWS plans for AWS Commerce Platform and define your own team\\'s future direction.· · Manage projects that deliver on commitments to our customers.· · Manage day-to-day activities of engineering team using Agile/Scrum methodology.· · Manage team\\'s resources: hire, mentor, and grow the engineering team.· · Work closely with engineers to architect and develop the best technical solutions.

An SDE is critical to the success of this team to build the data lake that enable our leaders to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement.In 2018, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.You will lead all phases of software development to build services to support our goal. Your systems will drive service and product efficiency opportunities, from idea generation to scoping, to strategy building and ultimately automation for self- monitoring, self-diagnosing and self-healing solutions. As the successful candidate, you will be a rock star developer, be data driven and have the ability to creatively deal with ambiguity, and juggle cross-organization complexity.

In short, we are inverting the man-machine paradigm by moving from human-driven to system-driven processes.

However, there are times when mistakes occur, and products get lost. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and prevent entropy?

Our current systems serve our current needs, but we are growing a new business within Amazon.com, and are looking for the sort of hands on leaders and developers who can design and build the systems that will take us into the future.About you:You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.About us together:We're going to change the way that the advertising world measures, plans, and buys. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.The ideal developer for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.Some problem spaces we'll be working on:AD PLATFORM - accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. You may specialize in one area or another, but will need to consider the problem holistically. Today, we are a global operation with infrastructure in North America, Europe and Asia and we are looking to enter India and Brazil. Our platform is hosted in AWS and we serve ads for Mobile (mobile web, Amazon mobile APPs and 3rd Party Mobile Apps) and Desktop Web (both on Amazon owned and operated properties as well as third party sites via Ad Exchanges and Direct relationships). we are looking to continue to rearchitect the platform this year to better enable us to handle the demands of scaling the business enabling both enterprise managed- and self-service growth in addition to small business self-service growth.OPTIMIZATION - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. Couple that with an almost overwhelming amount of real-time data and the need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict performance against our customers' goals. You’ll need to be both an engineer and scientist – you’ll build the platforms to test and measure your hypotheses, iterate on your designs, and find innovative signals and solutions that fundamentally shift the effectiveness of our systems.EXPERIMENTATION - advertisers spend a lot of money to develop their ads, and we want to ensure that those ads will drive the best performance possible. To do so, we need to develop the data, analysis and technical frameworks to enable incredibly precise, highly impactful decisions that directly impact the ad performance. Furthermore, the experimentation framework needs to provide the ability for our internal partners to configure and execute experiments on our algorithms and infrastructure with sufficiently low friction to encourage further experimentation.Questions?:You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.\",\n",

Our services already handle thousands of requests per second, make business decisions impacting billions of dollars a year, integrate with a network of small and large carriers, manage business rules for movements of millions of products, and improve our middle mile operations experience to deliver products for millions of online shoppers. That said, this remains a fast growing business and our technical journey has only started.Amazon’s global fulfillment network enables any merchant in any of the geography ship items that you order on Amazon, to any place on earth. There are a variety of ways in which we can acquire items from vendors to our warehouses, ship items from one location to another, and several intermediate locations through which the package travels before reaching the customer. There are millions of such packages, each with different attributes, and different delivery requirements. What results is a highly dense graph of source, intermediate and destination nodes, with arcs between them representing possible paths for packages, with different costs and times along each arc. Accounting for all these constraints, and maximizing the number of shipments shipped, while minimizing cost, providing a variety of delivery options and maximizing delivery performance is Transportation Engineering's primary focus.Our mission is to build the most efficient and optimal transportation solution on the planet, using our technology and engineering muscle as our biggest advantage. We aim to leverage cutting edge technologies in big data, machine learning, and optimization techniques, and operate high volume, low latency, and high availability services.

       "  \"Amazon.com's long-term vision is to enable a seamless experience for all Amazon customers worldwide on any Amazon website and device, in any language and for any culture. This extends the personalization of the shopping experience by allowing our customers to define their preferred language and currency and ensure that we provide an equivalent experience for our customers in their language of preference as we do customers in the default marketplace language.Our team started in early 2014 and, as of February 2018, we have launched multiple languages in 4 different marketplaces (US, Canada, Japan and Germany). Our goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces. We believe that, by establishing a platform team and providing tools and mechanisms to drive the adoption of this platform, we can broadly influence change across Amazon's Consumer Website while and auditing the quality of our customer experiences.About you:You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Amazon Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.About us together:We're going to change the way that Amazon thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.The ideal manager for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.Some problem spaces we'll be working on:LANGUAGE AND CURRENCY API ADOPTION - we need to develop a toolset that allows us to identify the set of teams across the Consumer org that should use our International preferences APIs and manage the program that will cause them to adopt these APIs. Given the scale of the problem, self-service tools are a necessity as automation is the path for success. We will be instrumental in defining the standards and approaches used broadly across Amazon as well as developing mechanisms that will audit our customer experience ensuring that we can identify and address any measurable deviation.LARGE MIGRATIONS - we have already identified several areas of increased risk, where adoption of the preferences APIs will be impactful to the owning teams' roadmaps. In these cases, we must influence the teams to develop a suitable design that meets the needs of the International consumer, driving thought leadership from a International perspective. Problems such as how we think about customer reviews in multiple languages and determining the customer satisfaction with the product fall under the remit of this space.END-TO-END TESTING - once we have addressed all of these issues, we must develop end-to-end test scenarios that will allow us to validate our work throughout the complexity of Amazon's Consumer stack.Questions?:As you can see, this provides an opportunity to be exposed to Amazon's entire consumer stack. You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.\",\n",

In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.AWS Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any AWS service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing AWS business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine \"declarative\".

Amazon’s Prime Video service launched in 2014 and has quickly become a strategic priority for the organization, reflected in the service’s recent expansion into over 200 countries and territories around the world. Amazon invests on acquiring, producing and programming TV shows & movies – from brand new, including must-see exclusive series like The Grand Tour, Neil Gaiman’s American Gods, to The Man in the High Castle, Transparent, Mr Robot and more.Prime Video is known for its ground-breaking impact, and in case you think there is nothing more to do, then think again. We are building a new global innovation platform designed to transform how we develop, test, verify and automate against physical devices. With hundreds of devices currently supported, and many more being certified in the future, we are changing how we work with devices to ensure that even at this scale we can assure the exceptional customer experience at all times.Prime Video product teams are continually striving to deliver more features, and platform improvements, faster through CI/CD delivery platforms. With platform complexity increasing, and aggressive increases in the number of customer device types, our ability to test on customer devices has understandably struggled to keep up.Join us on a mission to change that!We are designing the next generation cloud platform for both physical and virtual devices.As we work from the physical tiers, onto micro-processors and right through to rack capacity we will be building custom solutions from the hardware systems to the contention management software. We aim to take away the complexity of device management, so that it can become a plug-and-play global network of self-managing, and self-healing, capacity.We work from the AWS cloud down, so we will be wrapping this all up securely using the latest AWS frameworks and tools into consumable RESTful APIs. Clients will be delivered as well as SDKs to enable customers to integrate and extend the capabilities.We are looking for builders, inventors and generally awesome engineers. We are looking for people with experience in hardware and systems integration, as well as pure software backgrounds, and we will be building specialized teams to make the best use of your skills.Complex and challenging – yes!Ambitious and audacious – yes!Innovative and impactful – yes!Is this you? Then please apply, join us, and make history…Working with devices is a hard engineering problem, due to the fact that they typically share no standard operating system, I/O, installation or debugging tooling. We have to support all of them from the latest Android right through to Smart TVs.Our mission is to solve this problem. We plan to make working with devices easy to the point that it becomes a transparent platform with homogeneous APIs no matter how complex the device itself might be.We are looking for outstanding inventors who can design, build and own both low level hardware systems and integration with networks and networked capabilities such as power over IP racks, VPN systems, and SMART TVs and games consoles.You will be working to create software driven capabilities to control devices using micro-processors, or flashing firmware using APIs, as well as working out how to rack mount and control TVs and boards in racks globally. Operational excellence is also your concern, and so you will be expected to define and implement metrics, and operational systems to monitor them, to ensure a reliable, performant, secure and frugal platform is provided to consumers.Ideally you will be a polyglot who cares about using the right language and tool for the job, as opposed to thinking only within the limits of your own experience. If you want to stretch yourself, as well as the boundaries of what is possible in modern tech then look no further.This really is an opportunity to make history and own your future. You do not need to know everything, you just need to want to, and bring along a bag of enthusiasm and positivity for the journey. Sign up. Make the impact you always wanted to.You will be an inventor working with a talented team of like-minded inventors. Collaboration and passion are essential ingredients for success and you will be surrounded by driven, forward thinking individuals.

Do you want to apply your deep analytical and engineering skills to the space of highly-available replicated databases? Come join us in Amazon RDS and help us innovate with always-on databases in the AWS cloud!The AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is one of the largest cloud database businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are handled in an automated fashion by our control systems. Providing such simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage across multiple datacenters world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovations in our systems in order to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability requires building control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle many types of failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate various geographical distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases, multiple database engines (RDS supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server), and a wide variety of customer workloads.To achieve our goals in this area, we are looking for a Software Engineer who loves to dive in and solve fundamental Computer Science and Systems problems around performance, timing, state machine logic and distributed systems algorithms. Candidates need to have a strong sense of ownership, passion to provide a great customer experience and excellent troubleshooting skills even when in high-pressure situations.
